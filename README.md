# Simple command line utility

This was created for personal use. This contains a bunch of small command I normally use to check whether, or a domain is live etc.

## Install

If you want to use it, just download `builds/check` file and give it executable permission.

`sudo chmod +x check`

then run the command.

## To-do

Added a bunch of other command.
